# Go Benchmarks

In programming in general, and in Golang in particular, many roads lead to Rome.
From time to time I ask myself which of these ways is the fastest. 
In Golang there is a wonderful solution, with `go test -bench` you can measure the speed very easily and quickly.
In order for you to benefit from it too, I will publish such benchmarks in this repository in the future.

## Golang?

I published another repository where I show some Golang examples.
If you're interested in new programming languages, you should definitely take a look at Golang:

* [Golang examples](https://github.com/SimonWaldherr/golang-examples)
* [tour.golang.org](https://tour.golang.org/)
* [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/)
* [Golang Book](http://www.golang-book.com/)
* [Go-Learn](https://github.com/skippednote/Go-Learn)

## Is it any good?
